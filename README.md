# image-lab — Docker instructions

Build the Docker image (run from repository root):

```bash
docker build -t image-lab:latest .
```

Run the container, exposing port 5000:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 image-lab:latest
```

The Flask app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

Notes:
- The `Dockerfile` installs a small set of OS libraries commonly required by `opencv-python` wheels.
- For production, consider using a WSGI server (e.g. `gunicorn`) instead of the Flask development server.



## Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline

The project is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance using a fully automated pipeline.

* **Infrastructure:** Hosted on AWS EC2 (Ubuntu).
* **Containerization:** The application runs inside a Docker container for environment consistency.
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions detects changes to the `main` branch and executes `deploy.sh` via SSH (configured using Repository Secrets).
* **Networking & SSL:**
    * **Domain:** `imageprocessing.esmail.app` configured via A Record.
    * **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx handles incoming traffic and forwards requests to the local Docker container on port 5000.
    * **Security:** HTTPS is enforced using an SSL certificate generated by Certbot.
    * **Setup:** The Nginx and SSL configuration is automated via the `auto-domain-ssl.sh` script./CD
